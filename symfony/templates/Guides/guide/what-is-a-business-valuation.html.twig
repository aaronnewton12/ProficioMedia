                                        <ul>
                                            <ol><strong>Market Approach:</strong> This method relies on comparable company analysis and precedent transactions. It involves evaluating similar businesses in the market and analyzing the prices at which they were bought or sold. By examining the market multiples and applying them to the subject company, an estimated value can reached.</ol>
                                            <ol><strong>Income Approach:</strong> The income approach focuses on the future income-generating capacity. It includes methods like capitalization of earnings and discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis. Capitalization of earnings estimates the value based on the expected future earnings. DCF analysis takes into account the time value of money and calculates the present value of future cash flows.</ol>
                                            <ol><strong>Asset-Based Approach:</strong> This approach values a company based on its tangible and intangible assets. The adjusted book value method considers the net book value of assets adjusted for their fair market value. The liquidation value method determines the value if the business were to be liquidated.</ol>
                                        </ul>

                                        <p>Each of these methods provides a unique perspective on the value of a business. The choice of method depends on factors such as the nature of the business, industry standards, and available data. It is common for business valuations to use a combination of these methods.</p>
